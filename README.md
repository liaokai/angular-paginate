================

Module that provides UI-agnostic dynamic or static pagination using angular js.

Can be plugged into any css framework/use your own styles for pagination.

- UI agnostic pagination - no dependencies except angular js
- select which events fired will lead to pagination creation
- ease-of-use - implemented as angular directives
- supports static or dynamic data sets (e.g. data populated through REST calls)

See examples on how it has been used with twitter bootstrap css.
